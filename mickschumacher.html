                    <h1>Mick Schumacher</h1>
                    <h5>Haas F1 Team</h5>
                    <p>Plenty of sons of former F1 drivers have joined the sport over the years – two have even emulated their fathers to become world champions – but carrying the Schumacher name is surely an extra level of pressure for Mick, given his father Michael’s extraordinary achievements in Formula 1.

                        But Schumacher Junior, a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy, arrived in F1 in 2021 with Haas after clinching the previous season’s F2 title in 2020, to add to the F3 championship he won in 2018 – so there was zero suggestion he had been elevated to the top level of motorsport because of his name. 
                        
                        It’s talent that brought him this far and he showed more of the same as he acclimatised to F1 in a tough rookie season, consistently outclassing his team mate in their uncompetitive machinery.
                        
                        Now Schumacher must continue to impress if he is to one day follow in his father’s footsteps and claim a race seat with the Scuderia.</p>
